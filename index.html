                Thank you for taking moments of your time to explore my page. Enclosed below is brief history behind who I am.</p>
            <p class="abouttext">
                Brett was born in cataclysmic explosion which wiped out a vast, uninhabited wasteland, turning it into an even vaster wasteland. Upon learning the skill of walking, Brett went on an international slapping spree, hitting only the most annoying, which lasted a total of 77 days, and injured countless jerks. For his crimes, Brett was the youngest person ever to be tried as an adult, at the age of 4 months. The trial however, brought no one justice and devolved into a circus of the most atrocious kind.
                Having escaped punishment, Brett sought to better his life by redesigning socks so that the seams didn't rub underneath people's toenails. This venture earned him billions and he graciously used most of this money to create the world's largest pouch of Capri Sun because, as he states: "You drink the normal one in about 5 seconds." After satisfying the world's thirst, Brett has become an increasing rare public figure. Some claim to have seen him offering people pancakes of extraordinary quality, but so far, these sightings have not been rooted in any solid evidence.
